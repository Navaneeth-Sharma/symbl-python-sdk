# Symbl Python SDK

The Symbl Python SDK provides convenient access to the Symbl API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for a simple and clear utilization of APIs.

## Documentation

See the [Python API docs](https://docs.symbl.ai/docs/).

## Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify the package. If you just
want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install --upgrade symbl
```

Install from source with:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

## Configuration

To initialize the SDK, you need to provide app_id and app_token which you can get by signing up on [Symbl Platform][api-keys].

You can either provide the api_keys by saving a file named symbl.conf in your home directory in the following format.

>Home directory will be C:/Users/\<Your Username\> on your windows system, or ~ in your Linux or Mac system.

```conf
[credentials]
app_id=<app_id>
app_secret=<app_secret>
```

### Requirements

- Python 2.7+ or Python 3.4+ (PyPy supported)

### Usages

The library needs to be configured with your account's credentials (appId & appSecret) which is
available in your [Symbl Platform][api-keys].

## A speech to text converter under 5 lines of code

```python
import symbl

# Process audio file
conversation = symbl.Audio.process_file(
  # credentials={app_id: <app_id>, app_secret: <app_secret>}, #Optional, Don't add this parameter if you have symbl.conf file in your home directory
  file_path=<file_path>)

# Printing transcription messages
print(conversation.messages())
```

  ``` python

import symbl

payload = {
  "messages": [
    {
      "payload": {"content": "Hi Anthony. I saw your complaints about bad call reception on your mobile phone. Can I know what issues you are currently facing?"},
      "from": {"userId": "surbhi@example.com","name": "Surbhi Rathore"}
    },
    {
      "payload": {"content": "Hey Surbhi, thanks for reaching out. Whenever I am picking up the call there is a lot of white noise and I literally canâ€™t hear anything."},
      "from": {"userId": "anthony@example.com","name": "Anthony Claudia"}
    },
    {
      "payload": {"content": "Okay. I can schedule a visit from one of our technicians for tomorrow afternoon at 1:00 PM. He can look at your mobile and handle any issue right away"},
      "from": {"userId": "surbhi@example.com","name": "Surbhi Rathore"}
    },
    {
      "payload": {"content": "That will be really helpful. I'll follow up with the technician about some other issues too, tomorrow"},
      "from": {"userId": "anthony@example.com","name": "Anthony Claudia"}
    },
    {
      "payload": {"content": "Sure. We are happy to help. I am scheduling the visit for tomorrow. Thanks for using Abccorp networks. Have a good day."},
      "from": {"userId": "surbhi@example.com","name": "Surbhi Rathore"}
    }
  ]
}

conversation = symbl.Text.process(payload=payload)

print(conversation.action_items())
print(conversation.topics())
print(conversation.follow_ups())

  ```

## SpeechToText of multiple audio files in a directory

```python

import symbl
from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, join

# returns lambda function with fileName which is under processing
def save_transcriptions_in_file(fileName):
    return lambda conversation: on_success(conversation, fileName)

# returns actual callback to save the transcriptions of a conversation in a file
def on_success(conversation, fileName):
    transcriptions = conversation.messages()

    file = open(fileName + ".txt","w+")
    file.write(str(transcriptions))
    file.close()

# Look [here][unicodeerror], if you're getting unicode error
directory_path = r'<directory_path>'

files = [join(directory_path, file) for file in listdir(directory_path) if isfile(join(directory_path, file))]

# Process audio files in the above mentioned directory
for file in files:
    job = symbl.Audio.process_file(
      # credentials={app_id: <app_id>, app_secret: <app_secret>}, #Optional, Don't add this parameter if you have symbl.conf file in your home directory
      file_path=file, wait=False).on_complete(save_transcriptions_in_file(file))

```

## Analysis of your Zoom Call on your email (Symbl will join your zoom call and send you analysis on provided email)

```python

import symbl

phoneNumber = "" # Zoom phone number to be called, check here https://us02web.zoom.us/zoomconference
meetingId = "" # Your zoom meetingId
password = "" # Your zoom meeting passcode
emailId = ""

connection = symbl.Telephony.start_pstn(
      # credentials={app_id: <app_id>, app_secret: <app_secret>}, #Optional, Don't add this parameter if you have symbl.conf file in your home directory
      phone_number=phoneNumber,
      dtmf = ",,{}#,,{}#".format(meetingId, password),
      actions = [
        {
          "invokeOn": "stop",
          "name": "sendSummaryEmail",
          "parameters": {
            "emails": [
              emailId
            ],
          },
        },
      ]
    )

print(connection)

```

## Live audio transcript using your system's microphone

```python
import symbl

connection = symbl.Streaming.start_connection()

connection.subscribe({'transcript_response': lambda response: print('got this response from callback', response)})

connection.send_audio_from_mic()
```
